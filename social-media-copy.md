## 1. LINKEDIN POST (Douglas Goullet / Fideso)

**Your Beckham Law has an expiry date. Your wealth shouldn't.**

If you moved to Spain under the Beckham Law, you already know the benefits: a flat 24% rate, foreign income exempt, wealth tax on overseas assets excluded.

But here's what most people don't plan for — what happens when those six years end.

When the Beckham Law expires:
→ Worldwide income taxed at up to 47%
→ Global assets fall under Spain's Wealth Tax & Solidarity Tax
→ Unrealised capital gains may be subject to exit tax
→ Cross-border succession becomes complex and costly

Together with Javier Baquero Mazars from A&G Banca Privada and Marta García Cortés from Utmost Luxembourg, I'm hosting an exclusive evening at The Pool Marbella to present a proven, Luxembourg-based solution that addresses every one of these challenges — before the clock runs out.

📍 The Pool Marbella
📅 [Date TBD]
🕡 18:30

Spaces are limited. DM me or write to [email] to reserve your place.

## 2. LINKEDIN POST (Shorter / Teaser Version)

Six years go fast.

If you're living in Spain under the Beckham Law, the countdown to full worldwide taxation has already started. Most expats planned the move in — but few have planned for what comes after.

On [DATE], three firms are coming together at The Pool Marbella to show you how to protect your wealth before, during, and after the transition.

Fideso × A&G Banca Privada × Utmost Luxembourg.

Limited places. Details in comments or DM me.

## 5. WHATSAPP / DIRECT MESSAGE (Personal Invite)

Hi [Name],

I'm co-hosting an exclusive event at The Pool in Marbella with A&G Banca Privada and Utmost Luxembourg — specifically for international residents currently under (or about to enter) the Beckham Law.

We're going to cover something most people aren't planning for: what happens to your wealth when the six-year tax regime expires. It involves the Luxembourg Unit Linked — a structure that can defer taxes indefinitely, avoid exit tax, reduce wealth tax, and simplify cross-border succession.

📍 The Pool Marbella
📅 [Date TBD]
🕡 18:30 – 21:00
🍷 Presentation followed by networking and drinks

It's an invite-only event, limited to about 40 people. I thought of you because [personalise: e.g. "you mentioned thinking about your tax situation after Beckham" / "I know you've been in Spain for a few years now"].

Let me know if you'd like me to save you a spot.

Best,
Douglas
